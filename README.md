## Project Setup

Begin by cloning the provided project and importing it into your workspace.

`git clone <url for github repository>`

After cloning this repository you want to run these commands

`git checkout -b development`

This will create a branch named development and switch you to it. The development branch is where you will make all your commits.

```
git push -u origin development
```

This will push your development branch up to Github. Don't forget to make a pull request after you've made your first commit.
